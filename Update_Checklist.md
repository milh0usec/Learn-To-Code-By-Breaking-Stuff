# Update Checklist

Start every week by updating your software.

1. Open the Macintosh App Store app and select "Update" in the top nav bar. This updates GUI apps.
2. Updating CLI apps is more work. Start with updating Homebrew: ```brew update```
3. Next, update your Mac OS X CLI apps installed with Homebrew: ```brew upgrade```
4. Update Atom with ```Atom > Check for Updates```
5. Update your Atom packages in ```Atom > Preferences > Updates```.
6. Update your Node modules with npm-check-updates: ```ncu -g```.
